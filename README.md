# What is system design?

Before starting this course, let's talk about system design.

System design defines the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system that satisfies specific requirements. System design meets the needs of your business or organization through coherent and efficient systems. It requires a systematic approach to building and engineering systems. A good system design requires us to think about everything, from infrastructure all the way down to the data and how it's stored.



 # Computer Networking

## 1.load-balancing  
 
Load balancing is a technique used in system design to distribute incoming network traffic or application requests across multiple servers. This ensures that no single server is overwhelmed, which helps maintain high availability, efficient utilization of resources, and optimal performance.

### How Load Balancing Works
A load balancer acts like a ‚Äútraffic cop‚Äù sitting in front of your servers, routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests. This helps in:

- **Distributing Traffic**: Evenly spreading incoming requests to prevent any single server from being overloaded.
- **Enhancing Availability**: If one server fails, the load balancer redirects traffic to healthy servers.
- **Improving Performance**: By balancing the load, it ensures faster response times and better resource utilization.

### Types of Load Balancers
- **Hardware Load Balancers**: Physical devices that distribute traffic.
- **Software Load Balancers**: Applications that perform load balancing, often used in cloud environments.
- **DNS Load Balancers**: Use DNS to distribute traffic based on server availability and load.

### Load Balancing Algorithms

- **Round Robin**: Distributes requests sequentially across servers.
- **Least Connections**: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash**: Routes requests based on the client‚Äôs IP address.

### Implementing Load Balancing
You can implement load balancing using various tools and services, such as:

- **NGINX**: A popular web server that can also act as a load balancer.
- **HAProxy**: A reliable, high-performance TCP/HTTP load balancer.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS Elastic Load Balancing, Google Cloud Load Balancing, and Azure Load Balancer.

 

# Horizontal Scaling

Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers or machines to handle increased demand. Instead of upgrading a single server, you introduce additional servers to distribute the workload. This method helps balance the load across multiple servers, making the system more scalable as user traffic grows. For example, if a website experiences a surge in users and one server can't manage it, adding more servers will share the traffic, improving performance and reliability.

# Vertical Scaling

Vertical scaling means enhancing the power of a single server by increasing its hardware capabilities, like upgrading the CPU, RAM, or storage. This approach boosts the performance of the existing server to handle more load without needing additional machines. For instance, if a server becomes slow due to heavy usage, upgrading its RAM or processor can improve its ability to handle more tasks. Vertical scaling is ideal when you want to improve the capacity of one server without changing the system architecture.

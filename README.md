# What is system design?

Before starting this course, let's talk about system design.

System design defines the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system that satisfies specific requirements. System design meets the needs of your business or organization through coherent and effi[...]

## 1-load-balancing  
 
Load balancing is a technique used in system design to distribute incoming network traffic or application requests across multiple servers. This ensures that no single server is overwhelmed, which hel[...]

### How Load Balancing Works
A load balancer acts like a ‚Äútraffic cop‚Äù sitting in front of your servers, routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests. This helps in:

- **Distributing Traffic**: Evenly spreading incoming requests to prevent any single server from being overloaded.
- **Enhancing Availability**: If one server fails, the load balancer redirects traffic to healthy servers.
- **Improving Performance**: By balancing the load, it ensures faster response times and better resource utilization.

### Types of Load Balancers
- **Hardware Load Balancers**: Physical devices that distribute traffic.
- **Software Load Balancers**: Applications that perform load balancing, often used in cloud environments.
- **DNS Load Balancers**: Use DNS to distribute traffic based on server availability and load.

### Load Balancing Algorithms

- **Round Robin**: Distributes requests sequentially across servers.
- **Least Connections**: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash**: Routes requests based on the client‚Äôs IP address.

### Implementing Load Balancing
You can implement load balancing using various tools and services, such as:

- **NGINX**: A popular web server that can also act as a load balancer.
- **HAProxy**: A reliable, high-performance TCP/HTTP load balancer.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS Elastic Load Balancing, Google Cloud Load Balancing, and Azure Load Balancer.




## 2-what-is-a-cdn
A CDN is a globally distributed network of servers designed to enhance the performance and availability of web content. It reduces latency and accelerates the delivery of static assets, such as images, videos, and scripts, by storing copies on servers strategically positioned around the world¬π.

### Why Use a CDN?
1. **Faster Content Delivery**: By storing copies of website content on servers distributed globally, CDNs reduce the physical distance between users and the content, leading to faster load times.
2. **Improved Website Performance**: CDNs distribute the load on the origin server, preventing it from being overwhelmed by requests.
3. **Reduced Latency**: Serving content from servers closer to the end-users minimizes latency, especially beneficial for global audiences.
4. **Enhanced Scalability**: CDNs offload a significant portion of the traffic from the origin server, allowing websites to handle increased user traffic without compromising performance.
5. **Bandwidth Savings**: By caching and serving static content locally, CDNs reduce the load on the origin server, leading to significant bandwidth savings¬≤.

### How Does a CDN Work?
1. **Origin Server**: The original versions of the content are stored on the origin server.
2. **Edge Servers**: These are numerous and distributed across various locations globally. They store cached versions of the content.
3. **Request Routing**: When a user requests content, the CDN routes the request to the nearest edge server, minimizing the physical distance and reducing load times.
4. **Caching**: Static assets are cached on the edge servers. Subsequent requests for these assets are served from the edge servers instead of the origin server, reducing the load on the origin and improving scalability¬≤.

### Types of CDNs
1. **Push CDNs**: Content is uploaded directly to the CDN, and the CDN is responsible for delivering it. This is suitable for sites with infrequent content updates.
2. **Pull CDNs**: The CDN fetches content from the origin server when requested by a user. This is more dynamic and suitable for sites with frequently updated content¬≤.

### Design Considerations for a CDN
1. **Geographical Distribution**: Strategically place edge servers to cover major user bases.
2. **Caching Strategy**: Determine what content to cache and for how long.
3. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic efficiently across servers to prevent any single server from being overwhelmed.
4. **Security**: Implement measures like DDoS protection and secure data transmission.
5. **Scalability**: Ensure the CDN can handle increased traffic and data volumes¬π.

### Benefits of Using a CDN
- **Improved User Experience**: Faster load times and reduced latency enhance the overall user experience.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced bandwidth usage and server load can lead to cost savings.
- **Reliability**: Distributed servers ensure content availability even if one server fails¬π.

CDNs are crucial for modern web applications, ensuring fast, reliable, and scalable content delivery to users worldwide.
